**Game Technical Documentation**

1. **Where the Code is Hosted**
   The game code is hosted on a GitHub repository. You can find the repository at the following link:

   GitHub Repository: https://github.com/YourRepositoryLinkHere

   its also shared a console session called Hikmet Tenis Adventure Game with you on PythonAnywhere.

2. **External Services**
   There are no external services used in this game at the moment. The game runs entirely as a standalone Python application.

3. **Languages and Technologies**
   - **Programming Language**: Python
   - **Modules Used**: Standard Python libraries (such as `sys`, `random`), along with any additional libraries used to handle player input and game logic.
   - **Game Structure**: The game is structured in multiple Python scripts corresponding to each chapter and the professor character, plus the main file (`start.py`) that initiates the game.

4. **System Requirements and Supported Applications**
   - **Operating System**: The game is platform-independent and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, as long as Python 3.x is installed.
   - **Python Version**: Python 3.x (preferably 3.7 or higher)
   - **Required Packages**: No external packages required; all standard libraries should suffice.

5. **Coding/Naming Conventions**
   - **Variables and Functions**: Follow `snake_case` (e.g., `player_name`, `start_game`).
   - **Classes**: Follow `CamelCase` (e.g., `Professor`, `Character`).
   - **Constants**: Use all caps (e.g., `MAX_LIVES = 3`).
   - **File Naming**: Files are named according to their content (e.g., `chapter1.py`, `professor.py`).

6. **How to Run/Build/Deploy the Program**
   To run the program:
   1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
   2. Clone or copy the repository to your local machine.
   3. Navigate to the folder where the files are located using the command line.
   4. Run the following command:
      ```bash
      python3 start.py
      ```
      This will initiate the game.

   No build or deployment is required since the game runs as a script directly from the Python interpreter.

7. **Overview of the Architecture**
   The game consists of multiple Python files, each corresponding to different chapters and characters:
   - **`start.py`**: This is the main file that starts the game.
   - **`chapter1.py` to `chapter6.py`**: These files contain the code for each chapter of the game.
   - **`professor.py`**: This file contains the `Professor` character and defines their properties and actions within the game.
   
   All characters, including the professor and player, have certain properties like weapons and health. Chapters are linked in a sequence, advancing the storyline as the player progresses through challenges.

8. **How to Start the Program (Start the Game)**
   1. Make sure you are in the correct directory where the game files are stored.
   2. Run the command:
      ```bash
      python3 start.py
      ```
   3. The game will prompt you to make choices and proceed through each chapter. The `Professor` character will be introduced at the appropriate point in the game.
